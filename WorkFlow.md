Succinct Data Work Flow
=======================

Creating or updating forms
--------------------------

ODK forms are created in the normal way.  Not all features are
supported by succinct data at this time.

STATUS: This functionality is operational.

Preparing ODK forms for use with Succinct Data
----------------------------------------------

Forms are prepared by running xml2recipe over them, which will produce
the recipe file and template file.

The recipe file describes the type of each field in the form to be
included in the succinct data.  

BUG: The recipe file may need hand modification for a variety of
reasons. The recipe file can be hand modified before first distribution to
phones, for example to exclude certain fields or place limits on the
lengths of fields.  However, if you modify the recipe file then any
succinct data messages created to the previous version of the recipe
will be impossible to read, and succinct data will grossly
misinterpret any such messages.  Eventually we intend to support the
use of succinct data attributes in the ODK XML form so that hand
modification is never required.

The recipe and template files should be copied to the succinct directory
of your succinct data bundle marshalling area. You will also need to
include a smac.dat file for SMAC to reference when compressing
succinct data messages.  

NOTE: The same version of smac.dat must be used for
all forms, or else messages will be grossly misinterpretted by
succinct data resulting in gobbledygook.  Just use the version we have
supplied to avoid problems.

STATUS: This functionality is operational.

Pushing form bundles to phones
------------------------------

Use the assemble_bundle script in the examples directory of this
repository to create a .succinct.config directory that can be
installed on phones.  

The .succinct.config file should be copied into
/servalproject/sam/configs on the SD card of the phone.

You then need to start "Serval SAM" on the phone and go into
preferences and eventually select the file (or it will be selected
automatically) and reload configuration.

For some partly out of date instructions from the previous life of
Serval SAM that may nonetheless be useful:

STATUS: This functionality is operational.

BUG: Reloading configuration deletes all previous form instances, when
it probably shouldn't.

Using forms
-----------

The succinctdata branch of
http://github.com/servalproject/survey-acquisition-management ("Serval
SAM") is used to select the form to complete.  It automatically
launches ODK Collect, and then captures the form when complete, and
extracts it's succinct data for transmission.  

There is (currently) about a 20 second delay from form completion
before the succinct data is extracted.  We will look into reducing or
removing this delay.

The succinct data is written to the sdcard in the
servalproject/sam/succinct_spool directory.

The succinct data messages include an identity token that allows the
receive side to determine which form was used to create it.  This is
based on a hash of the recipe file name, not contents, so recipe files
should not be modified when auto-generated by xml2recipe, and whenever
changing an ODK form specification one should be sure to increment the
version field.

BUG: Auto-detection of form type relies on the filename not content of
form recipes.  This should change in a future version to be based on
the content of the recipe so that mis-matches cannot occur.  This is
important since mis-matches render the data unreadable.

A separate program is expected to collect the succinct data, and
transmit it via appropriate means.  See below.

STATUS: This functionality is operational.

Transmitting completed forms via SMS/inReach
--------------------------------------------

We intend to write program that sends succinct data messages by either
SMS or inReach depending on which is available.

Transmission will be able to be automatic or manually controlled.

STATUS: This program has yet to be written.

Receiving completed forms via SMS/inReach
-----------------------------------------

On the receive side, the succinct data messages must be written to a
file, and then fed through the SMAC program which takes the following
arguments: 

smac recipe decompress <recipe directory> <succinct data file> <output file>

To obtain the XML form, then a further call is required, and requires
the matching XML template file:

smac recipe rexml <output file from previous command> <template file>
<output XML file>

Succinct data messages encode the identity of the recipe within them,
allowing the recipe decompression process to automatically determine
the correct recipe, and hence ODK form specification to use when
reconstituting a succinct data message.

BUG: The above steps should happen in a single command, and the
resulting XML should be written to a deterministically and uniquely
named file based on the form and the form contents.

STATUS: Work in progress.  Many of the components exist, but are not
yet integrated.
